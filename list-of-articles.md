## General advice
As a general documentation structure improvement, I would suggest moving reference materials into a separate top-level category alongside "Language Guide" and "Tutorials" categories. At first glance, the category would include materials such as the "Core Libraries" and "Reference" sections.

## On content reuse
I am aware that Markdown and Jekyll are not well fitted for content reuse, but I find that some parts of more complex articles might be reused in other documentation categories (e.g., tutorials or reference materials). I explicitly note such possibilities in articles description.

## Subject-specific structure suggestions
Despite that the test task declares that there is no official documentation on Kotlin testing, I've found out, that it is more likely scattered all over the documentation rather than completely absent. With that in mind, I would suggest gathering viable information in one first-level section of the "Language Guide" category and adding some task-oriented tutorials.

### The "Language Guide" category

- title: Testing in Kotlin
  description: "Testing in Kotlin" is a first-level section that provides a set of articles (guides and concepts) on the subject. The section comes after the "More Language Constructs" section in the "Language Guide" category, thus assuming that a reader is familiar with various language concepts and approaches.
  
  - title: Unit Testing in Kotlin
    description: The introductory guide that briefly describes the basics of the Kotlin unit testing and provides basic instructions on how to configure projects for various platforms and create and run a simple Kotlin unit test. Parts of the article might be reused as corresponding tutorials.
  - title: Annotations and Assertions
    description: The article contains an extensive description and usage examples of the tools provided by the `kotlin.test` library.
  - title: Testing Frameworks Usage
    description: The article contains guides on how to configure and use various testing frameworks for different platforms. Parts of the article might be reused as corresponding tutorials. However, I would go for one uniform article in the "Testing in Kotlin" section, over than adding multiple tutorials for each recommended framework. But it's debatable.
  - title: Mocking in Testing
    description: The article describes what "mocking in testing" is and provides examples of Kotlin-specific (i.e., usage of data classes) practices as well as usage examples for recommended mocking libraries (Mockk or others). Parts of the article might be reused as corresponding tutorials.
  - title: Asynchronous Testing in Kotlin
    description: The article provides information on how to write asynchronous tests using JS `promise`. If the article ends up very short and task-specific, I'd consider moving it to the JS section of the "Tutorials" category. Otherwise, parts of the article might be reused as corresponding tutorials.
  - title: Improving Kotlin Tests
    description: The article contains best practices, which developers should follow to create better and more idiomatic Kotlin unit tests. The article might include information provided [here](https://phauer.com/2018/best-practices-unit-testing-kotlin/) and [here](https://phauer.com/2019/modern-best-practices-testing-java/). Additionally, the article might include auxiliary information on the topic, such as blog posts, videos from conferences, and so on.

- title: Tools

  - description: The section might include several guides for different recommended tools such as testing frameworks and libraries (e.g., Kotest, JUnit 5, MockK). I'd prefer to have uniform articles (see above) in the "Testing in Kotlin" section.

Tutorials category

- Java Interop
  - title: Testing a JVM project
    description: The topic covers Kotlin testing information specific for JVM projects. Might reuse certain parts from the "Unit Testing in Kotlin" article.
- JavaScript
  - title: Testing a JS project
    description: The topic covers Kotlin testing information specific for JS projects. Might reuse certain parts from the "Unit Testing in Kotlin" and "Asynchronous Testing in Kotlin" articles. Also, I'd consider incorporating or rather substituting the current "Running tests" article. 
- Multiplatform Projects 
  - title: Testing an MPP.
    description: The topic covers Kotlin testing information specific for MPP. Might reuse certain parts from the "Unit Testing in Kotlin" article.
- Native
  - title: Testing a Native Project.
    description: The topic covers Kotlin testing information specific for Native projects. Might reuse certain parts from the "Unit Testing in Kotlin" article.

In conclusion, I would like to indicate that having one first-level "Testing in Kotlin" section goes quite well with the current documentation structure and may be pretty futureproofed in case of any significant restructurations.
